    <a href="https://www.smartschoolhouse.com/easy-recipe/chocolate-chip-cookies">Original Recipe</a>
    <hr>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong> - We use brown sugar and white granulated sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong> - 1 stick of cold butter (no need to let the butter come to room temp!).</li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong> - Just one egg (can substitute this for 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce).</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla</strong> - Vanilla is the flavor booster in cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking Soda</strong> - Helps keep homemade cookies soft and tender</li>
        <li><strong>Corn Starch</strong> - Makes the cookies full and thick</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong> - All baked goods need salt, it helps balance the sweetness.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate Chips</strong> - 1 FULL bag of chocolate chips. Yes, you could use less… but why?</li>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong> - I used all-purpose for this recipe</li>
        <li><strong>Walnut Pieces</strong> - Optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe Tips</h2>
        <li><strong>Do Not Over Mix the Dough</strong> - Overmixing will result in dry, crumbly, and hard cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Do Not Over Bake Them</strong> - I bake mine at a high temperature for only 6 minutes. They continue to cook while they cool, but you can still eat them before they’re fully cooled for the softest cookies EVER!</li>

    <h2>Instructions </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 475°.</li>
        <li>Prepare baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>In the smaller mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, corn starch, salt, and baking soda.</li>
        <li>Cut the stick of butter into smaller pieces (as seen in the video).</li>
        <li>In the larger mixing bowl, combine the butter, sugar, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Gently stir the dry ingredients (flour, corn starch, salt, etc.) into the larger bowl with the butter/egg/sugar mixture (as seen in the video).</li>
        <li>Add in chocolate chips and optional walnuts. Mix gently until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Using a full size spoon (tablespoon), make cookie dough balls and place them on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 6-7 minutes or until the tops of the cookies get golden/brown (keep your eye on them:).</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let them cool. They'll continue to cook on the inside while they cool.</li>
        <li>For the softest cookies, eat them when they are warm, not totally cooled.</li>
    </ol>
