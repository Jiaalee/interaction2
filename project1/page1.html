        <p>In life, the number of beginnings is exactly  
            equal to the number of endings: no one has  
            yet to begin a life who will not end it.
        <div>
            In poetry, the number of beginnings so far 
            exceeds the number of endings that we cannot 
            even conceive of it. Not every poem is <br>

            <div class="hidden hidden1">
                <p>—one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is <br> 
                    carried away by the wind, which may be an ending, <br> 
                    but it is the ending of a poem without an end.</p>

        <div>Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, 
            once said that no poem is ever <span class="trigger trigger-2">ended,</span> that  
            every poem is merely abandoned.
            This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé,
            for where quotations begin is in a cloud.

             Paul Valéry also described his perception

            the weird theatrical shit is what goes on

            an animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret,
            has in his actions drama, but no theater;
            theater requires that you draw a circle around
            the action and observe it from outside the <span class="trigger trigger-8">circle;</span>
            
            <div class="hidden hidden8">
