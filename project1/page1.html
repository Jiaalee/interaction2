        <p>In life, the number of beginnings is exactly <br> 
            equal to the number of endings: no one has <br> 
            yet to begin a life who will not end it.</p>
        <p>In poetry, the number of beginnings so far <br> 
            exceeds the number of endings that we cannot <br> 
            even conceive of it. Not every poem is <br><span class="trigger-1">finished</span></p>
    
    <div class="hidden1">
        <p>—one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is <br> 
            carried away by the wind, which may be an ending, <br> 
            but it is the ending of a poem without an end.</p>

        <p>Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker,<br> 
            once said that no poem is ever <span class="trigger-2">ended,</span> that <br> 
            every poem is merely abandoned.<br> 
            This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé,<br> 
            for where quotations begin is in a cloud.</p>

           <p> Paul Valéry also described his perception<br> 
            of first lines so vividly, and to my mind<br> 
            so accurately, that i have never forgotten<br> 
            it: the opening line of a poem, he <span class="trigger-3 ">said,</span>

                <p>“ is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen<br> 
                    fruit you have never seen before, and the poet's task is<br> 
                    to create the tre from which such a fruit would fall. ”</p>

        <p>In the beginning was the Word. Western<br> 
            civilization rests upon those words. And<br> 
            yet there is a lively group of thinkers who<br> 
            believe that in the beginning was the Act.<br> 
            that nothing can precede <span class="trigger-4">action</span></p>
        <div class="hidden3">—no breath before act, no thought before act,<br> 
            no pervasive love before some kind of act.</div>
