    <h2>Chocolate Chip Cookie</h2>
    <a href="https://www.smartschoolhouse.com/easy-recipe/chocolate-chip-cookies">Original Recipe</a>
    <h2>--------------------------------------</h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h2>Sugar</h2>We use brown sugar and white granulated sugar.
    <h2>Butter</h2>1 stick of cold butter (no need to let the butter come to room temp!).
    <h2>Egg</h2>Just one egg (can substitute this for 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce).
    <h2>Vanilla</h2>Vanilla is the flavor booster in cookies.
    <h2>Baking Soda</h2>Helps keep homemade cookies soft and tender
    <h2>Corn Starch</h2>Makes the cookies full and thick
    <h2>Salt</h2>All baked goods need salt, it helps balance the sweetness.
    <h2>Chocolate Chips</h2>1 FULL bag of chocolate chips. Yes, you could use less… but why?
    <h2>Flour</h2>I used all-purpose for this recipe
    <h2>Walnut Pieces</h2>Optional
    <h2>--------------------------------------</h2>
    <h2>Recipe Tips</h2>
    <h2>Do Not Over Mix the Dough</h2>Overmixing will result in dry, crumbly, and hard cookies.
    <h2>Do Not Over Bake Them</h2>I bake mine at a high temperature for only 6 minutes. They continue to cook while they cool, but you can still eat them before they're fully cooled for the softest cookies EVER!
    <h2>--------------------------------------</h2>
    <h2>Instructions </h2>
    <h2>1</h2>Preheat oven to 475°.
    <h2>2</h2>Prepare baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent sticking.
    <h2>3</h2>In the smaller mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, corn starch, salt, and baking soda.
    <h2>4</h2>Cut the stick of butter into smaller pieces (as seen in the video).
    <h2>5</h2>In the larger mixing bowl, combine the butter, sugar, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract.
    <h2>6</h2>Gently stir the dry ingredients (flour, corn starch, salt, etc.) into the larger bowl with the butter/egg/sugar mixture (as seen in the video).
    <h2>7</h2>Add in chocolate chips and optional walnuts. Mix gently until fully combined.
    <h2>8</h2>Using a full size spoon (tablespoon), make cookie dough balls and place them on the baking sheet.
    <h2>9</h2>Bake for 6-7 minutes or until the tops of the cookies get golden/brown (keep your eye on them:).
    <h2>10</h2>Remove from the oven and let them cool. They'll continue to cook on the inside while they cool.
    <h2>11</h2>For the softest cookies, eat them when they are warm, not totally cooled.
